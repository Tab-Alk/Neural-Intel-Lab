Human brain memory is a complex and dynamic process involving multiple systems. The two primary types are short-term (or working) memory and long-term memory. Short-term memory is managed by the prefrontal cortex. It allows us to hold a small amount of information (roughly 7 items) in an active, easily accessible state for a short period. This is the memory we use to remember a phone number just long enough to dial it. It is crucial for reasoning and decision-making. Long-term memory is not stored in one single location but is distributed across different brain regions. The hippocampus is critical for the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory. Long-term memories are encoded through synaptic plasticity, where the connections between neurons are strengthened or weakened. This process is much more organic than writing to a database. Memories are reconstructive; every time we recall something, we are rebuilding the memory, which can sometimes lead to inaccuracies or alterations over time. There are different types of long-term memory, including episodic (events), semantic (facts), and procedural (skills).
