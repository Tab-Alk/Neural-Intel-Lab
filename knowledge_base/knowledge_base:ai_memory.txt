Artificial Intelligence (AI) memory can be broadly categorized into two types: short-term and long-term memory, much like the human brain, but the implementation is vastly different. Short-term memory in AI is often analogous to the context window of a large language model (LLM). This is a temporary workspace that holds the immediate input and recent conversation history. For instance, in a chatbot, the context window allows the AI to remember what was said a few turns ago. However, this memory is volatile and has a fixed size. Once information scrolls out of the context window, it is forgotten. Long-term memory for AI is achieved through a process of training and fine-tuning on vast datasets. The 'knowledge' is encoded into the model's parameters, or weights. This is a slow, offline process. A more dynamic form of long-term memory is implemented in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. These systems connect the AI to an external knowledge base, like a vector database. When a query is made, the system retrieves relevant information from this database and provides it to the AI as part of its context, allowing it to access vast amounts of specific, up-to-date information.
